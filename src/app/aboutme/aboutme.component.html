            <div class="text-left max-w-2xl text-lg">
                Hello! My name is Phil Burney and I am a Software Engineer.
                I started life in Polk County, North Carolina, a rural county in the foothills of the beautiful Blue
                Ridge mountains.
                Here, I grew up, graduated from high school and attended North
                Carolina State University shortly after I graduated high school.
                After a year of exploring what NCSUâ€™s engineering program had to offer in my freshman, I decided to
                pursue a degree in Computer Science.
                At the time, coding seemed very interesting, and Computer Science allows for creativity and problem
                solving that most other
                engineering degrees cannot match. I was very successful in pursuing this degree, and I graduated at the
                top of my class with a Computer Science degree in 2022.

                I spend my free time tinkering, coding, and making things run again. Here are a few of my non-coding
                activities that I do in my free time:

                I also spend a bit of my free time learning new coding languages, and how to write good, clean code.
                These are a few of my notable coding projects:
